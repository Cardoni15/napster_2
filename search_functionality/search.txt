This folder will contain all functions required for lyrical search.

development.ipynb is a place for scratch work. 
The notebook format allows for different functions to be tried and repeated without re-running the entire script.
After a section of code passes in my notebook I will move it into the relevant python file as a function for others to use.

search_lyrics.py contains all search functions.
The Rocchio feedback filter lives here.
